=Android Keystore Password Recovery= 


A few weeks ago I just forgot the password for my android keystore, so I cant update my app for the market. So I decided to code a little bruteforcing tool to recovery my password.

= Details =

There are 3 Methods to recover your keystore password:

  # - Simply Bruteforce 
  # - Dictionary Attack
  # - Smart Wordlist Attack

In my opinion the last option is the best. You specify some password segments in a textfile. All the segments will be permute and mixed together with numbers. e.g:

your password is: got2loveYa11
in your dictionary should be:
{{{
got
love
ya
}}}
Numbers are added automatically. Each word will be added twice, once like you wrote and once with the first letter capitalized, so you just have to write your words once if your are not shure if you first letter was uppercase or lowercase

Good luck

download [http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/java-se-jre-7-download-432155.html here]


=== Download the latest version of the Tool ===
https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_Rw7kNjv3BATldrLXMwcVRud2c/edit?usp=sharing


=== execute with ===

{{{
java -jar AndroidKeystoreBrute.jar <args>
}}}

=== possible args ===
{{{
-m <1..3> Method
-k <path>  path to your keystore
-d <path> dictionary (for method 2 and 3)
-p use common replacements like '@' for 'a'(for method 3) WARNING - very slow!! 
-start <String> sets the start String for the password (for brute force)
-w writes a new keystore with same password than the key

{{{
java -jar AndroidKeystoreBrute_v1.05.jar -m 1 -k <...keystore> -start AAAAAA
}}}

{{{
java -jar AndroidKeystoreBrute_v1.05.jar -m 2 -k "C:\\mykeystore.keystore" -d "wordlist.txt" 
}}}

=== example for smart wordlist attack (recommend)===
{{{
java -jar AndroidKeystoreBrute_v1.05.jar -m 3 -k "C:\\mykeystore.keystore" -d "wordlist.txt" 
}}}

*If there are any spaces in path or filenames, you have to use quotes for the path!!*


If you want to work on your pc while this is running, just decrease the priority of java.exe (dont't know how to do it in Linux etc..)

If you have to interrupt the brute force you can restart it with adding -start "LASTPWD"
